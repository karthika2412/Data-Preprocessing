# Data-Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is the process of converting raw data into a well-readable format to be used by a machine learning model.
Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors.
Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues.

### Happy learning!
